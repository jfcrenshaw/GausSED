# GausSED
Deconvolving SED's from photometry using Interdomain Stochastic Variational Gaussian Processes (I-SVGP) 


## Development

To work on GausSED, after cloning this repo:
1. Create a virtual environment with Python =>3.5, <3.9.  
E.g., with conda `conda create -n gaussed python=3.8`
2. Install GausSED in edit mode (optionally with the `interactive` flag).  
I.e., in the root directory, `pip install -e .[interactive]`
